# 🧩 Dynamic Programming

A curated collection of **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problems and solutions that I’ve implemented and documented for practice, learning, and reference.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository serves as my personal notebook of dynamic programming explorations — from foundational patterns to more advanced variations.  
Each file represents a problem I’ve solved, including my reasoning process, implementation, and insights gained along the way.

## 🗂️ Contents

Here are some of the current files and what they cover:

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `can_it_be_summed.py` | Determine whether a subset of numbers can sum to a target value |
| `largest_increasing_subarray.py` | Find the largest contiguous increasing subarray |
| `largest_subarray_average.py` | Maximize the average value of a subarray |
| `largest_subarray_sum.py` | Compute the maximum subarray sum (Kadane’s algorithm variant) |
| `rain_drop.py` | Compute trapped rainwater between bars |
| `steps.py` | Count the number of ways to climb stairs (classic DP) |

> 📝 Each script is self-contained, well-commented, and can be run independently.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Strengthen understanding of **DP states, transitions, and recurrence relations**
- Practice converting **recursive → memoized → bottom-up** solutions
- Build a structured **reference** for revisiting common DP patterns
- Document reasoning for **future reference and sharing**
